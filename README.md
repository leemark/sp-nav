## What is it for?
It's for single-page navigation menus. You create a menu linked to locations (by ID) within a single page, you style the menu with CSS, and this javascript will handle the rest.

## Can I use it? 
You're welcome to take a look and use whatever you like, but this is under easrly development and is NOT intended to be in a usable, distributable state at this time. Soon though.
